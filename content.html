For example, when you negotiate with your banker or your supplier, any agreement which results will likely reflect market value and commercially reasonable terms and conditions. When you loan money to your son or daughter, you may be inclined to provide much more favorable terms and conditions. The first example would be considered to be an arm's length relationship, while the second example would not. When your corporation does business with or makes loans to corporate officers and directors, the relationship must be at arm's length to avoid conflicts of interest.

If there is a claim against your corporation, other than a claim by the government, it will likely be based in contract or tort.

   What is an Elevator Pitch?
  </p>
  <p>
   Friday,  11:31 AM
  </p>
  <p>
   An elevator pitch is a concise and persuasive summary of a product, service, or idea that can be delivered within the span of an elevator ride, typically around 30 seconds to two minutes. The purpose of an elevator pitch is to capture the listener's attention, generate interest, and leave a lasting impression. It should effectively communicate the value proposition, unique selling points, and offering benefits clearly and compellingly. The term "elevator pitch" suggests that the pitch should be concise enough to be delivered during a brief encounter, such as an elevator ride, with limited time to make an impact.

   Elements of an Elevator Pitch

  </p>
  <p>
   Elements of an effective pitch Crafting an effective elevator pitch involves more than just summarizing your professional or business proposition. It requires a strategic structure that captivates and persuades. This structure should include a compelling start, a clear explanation of a problem your prospect is facing, and your unique solution. You should also convey your distinct value, evidence of success, and a call to action. This format ensures your pitch is not only informative but also engaging and memorable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here’s a quick rundown:
  </p>
  <p>
   A compelling lead: Hook them with a unique opening statement. 1.
  </p>
  <p>
   Problem and solution: Introduce a challenge and highlight your solution. 2.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unique value proposition: Share why your approach is different from the rest. 3.
  </p>
  <p>
   Evidence of success: Briefly cite a success story or achievement. 4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Call to action: Finish with an invitation to continue the conversation. 5.

   Writing the Ultimate Elevator Pitch
  </p>
  <p>
   There are many different ways to create a good elevator pitch; the pitch you create should
  </p>
  <p>
   ultimately reflect your business, personality, and/or current situation. The seven steps
  </p>
  <p>
   enumerated below are merely guidelines to creating a solid elevator pitch:
  </p>
  <p>
   Step 1: Define Who You Are
  </p>
  <p>
   The first sentence of your pitch should be a proper introduction of yourself. Keep this
  </p>
  <p>
   introduction as short and concise as possible. Stick to necessary, relevant details. There’s no
  </p>
  <p>
   need to go on and on about everything in your life.
  </p>
  <p>
   Step 2: Define What You Do
  </p>
  <p>
   Your elevator pitch should contain a 1-2 sentence mission statement explaining what you do in
  </p>
  <p>

  </a>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   Page 50
  </h2>
  <p>
   Your elevator pitch should contain a 1-2 sentence mission statement explaining what you do in
  </p>
  <p>
   your professional life. It should outline what your goal is and how you work toward it on a daily
  </p>
  <p>
   basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Step 3: Identify Your Target Audience
  </p>
  <p>
   If you don’t know to whom you are selling, it doesn’t matter what you’re selling. Identifying
  </p>
  <p>
   your ideal clients/customers in 1-2 sentences will further prove the viability of your business
  </p>
  <p>
   idea.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note: For job seekers, the target audience will be potential employers in a relevant field or
  </p>
  <p>
   industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Step 4: Demonstrate What Makes You Stand Out
  </p>
  <p>
   Your pitch needs a unique selling proposition (USP), which is the main quality that sets you
  </p>
  <p>
   apart from your competition. This could be a thoroughly refined skill, profound leadership
  </p>
  <p>
   qualities, a specific background, etc. One or two sentences of your pitch should be dedicated to
  </p>
  <p>
   explaining your USP and how it sets you apart from competitors (or other job seekers).
  </p>
  <p>
   Step 5: State What You Wish to Happen
  </p>
  <p>
   Your pitch needs a call to action that tells the audience exactly what you want from them. Of
  </p>
  <p>
   course, you don’t just blurt out “Give me money for my venture” or “I want a job”; that would
  </p>
  <p>
   be rude and presumptuous. You can, however, ask to schedule a meeting or grab a coffee to
  </p>
  <p>
   chat further.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the very least, you can ask the person to whom you’re pitching for advice on how you can
  </p>
  <p>
   improve your pitch. This way, even if they end up unconvinced, you can still get some useful
  </p>
  <p>
   information from the interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Step 6: Create the Hook
  </p>
  <p>
   You need to have a clear, big-picture understanding of your pitch before you can whittle it
  </p>
  <p>
   down to a good hook that introduces your premise and draws the audience in. This is why
  </p>
  <p>
   writing the hook comes later in the process. Elevator Pitches Page 50
  </p>
  <h2>
   Page 51
  </h2>
  <p>
   writing the hook comes later in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your hook should be a sentence or two that piques your audience’s curiosity. You may want to
  </p>
  <p>
   pose your hook in the form of a question, as it’s a tried and true marketing technique that
  </p>
  <p>
   never gets old.
  </p>
  <p>
   Step 7: Neatly Summarize Everything
  </p>
  <p>
   Trim the fat, leave in the most important parts, and wrap it up nicely. Remember that you’ll
  </p>
  <p>
   have a minute at most to make your pitch. Every word counts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your pitch should also flow nicely. Work with your pitch’s form until it feels conversational.

   Step-by-step guide on how to prepare an effective presentation
  </p>
  <p>
   Preparing an effective presentation starts with laying a strong foundation that goes beyond just creating slides and notes. One of the quickest and best ways to make a presentation would be with the help of a good presentation software.
  </p>
  <p>
   Otherwise, let me walk you to how to prepare for a presentation step by step and unlock the secrets of crafting a professional presentation that sets you apart.
  </p>
  <p>
   1. Understand the audience and their needs
  </p>
  <p>
   Before you dive into preparing your masterpiece, take a moment to get to know your target audience. Tailor your presentation to meet their needs and expectations, and you’ll have them hooked from the start!
  </p>
  <p>
   2. Conduct thorough research on the topic
  </p>
  <p>
   Time to hit the books (or the internet)! Don’t skimp on the research with your presentation materials — dive deep into the subject matter and gather valuable insights. The more you know, the more confident you’ll feel in delivering your presentation.
  </p>
  <p>
   3. Organize the content with a clear structure
  </p>
  <p>
   No one wants to stumble through a chaotic mess of information. Outline your presentation with a clear and logical flow. Start with a captivating introduction, follow up with main points that build on each other and wrap it up with a powerful conclusion that leaves a lasting impression.
  </p>
  <p>
   Delivering an effective business presentation hinges on captivating your audience, and Venngage’s professionally designed business presentation templates are tailor-made for this purpose. With

   presentation templates are tailor-made for this purpose. With thoughtfully structured layouts, these templates enhance your message’s clarity and coherence, ensuring a memorable and engaging experience for your audience members.
  </p>
  <p>
   Don’t want to build your presentation layout from scratch? pick from these 5 foolproof presentation layout ideas that won’t go wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
   4. Develop visually appealing and supportive visual aids
  </p>
  <p>
   Spice up your presentation with eye-catching visuals! Create slides that complement your message, not overshadow it. Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words, but that doesn’t mean you need to overload your slides with text.
  </p>
  <p>
   Well-chosen designs create a cohesive and professional look, capturing your audience’s attention and enhancing the overall effectiveness of your message. Here’s a list of carefully curated PowerPoint presentation templates and great background graphics that will significantly influence the visual appeal and engagement of your presentation.
  </p>
  <p>
   5. Practice, practice and practice
  </p>
  <p>
   Practice makes perfect — rehearse your presentation and arrive early to your presentation to help overcome stage fright. Familiarity with your material will boost your presentation skills and help you handle curveballs with ease.
  </p>
  <p>
   6. Seek feedback and make necessary adjustments
  </p>
  <p>
   Don’t be afraid to ask for help and seek feedback from friends and colleagues. Constructive criticism can help you identify blind spots and fine-tune your presentation to perfection.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Venngage’s real-time collaboration feature, receiving feedback and editing your presentation is a seamless process. Group members can access and work on the presentation simultaneously and edit content side by side in real-time. Changes will be reflected immediately to the entire team, promoting seamless teamwork.

   7. Prepare for potential technical or logistical issues
  </p>
  <p>
   Prepare for the unexpected by checking your equipment, internet connection and any other potential hiccups. If you’re worried that you’ll miss out on any important points, you could always have note cards prepared. Remember to remain focused and rehearse potential answers to anticipated questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   8. Fine-tune and polish your presentation
  </p>
  <p>
   As the big day approaches, give your presentation one last shine. Review your talking points, practice how to present a presentation and make any final tweaks. Deep breaths — you’re on the brink of delivering a successful presentation!

   9 effective techniques to deliver a memorable presentation
  </p>
  <p>
   Whether you’re an experienced presenter or a novice, the right techniques will let your presentation skills soar to new heights!
  </p>
  <p>
   From public speaking hacks to interactive elements and storytelling prowess, these 9 effective presentation techniques will empower you to leave a lasting impression on your audience and make your presentations unforgettable.
  </p>
  <p>
   1. Confidence and positive body language
  </p>
  <p>
   Positive body language instantly captivates your audience, making them believe in your message as much as you do. Strengthen your stage presence and own that stage like it’s your second home! Stand tall, shoulders back and exude confidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. Eye contact with the audience
  </p>
  <p>
   Break down that invisible barrier and connect with your audience through their eyes. Maintaining eye contact when giving a presentation builds trust and shows that you’re present and engaged with them.
  </p>
  <p>
   3. Effective use of hand gestures and movement
  </p>
  <p>
   A little movement goes a long way! Emphasize key points with purposeful gestures and don’t be afraid to walk around the stage. Your energy will be contagious!
  </p>
  <p>
   4. Utilize storytelling techniques
  </p>
  <p>
   Weave the magic of storytelling into your presentation. Share relatable anecdotes, inspiring success stories or even personal experiences that tug at the heartstrings of your audience. Adjust your pitch, pace and volume to match the emotions and intensity of
  </p>
  <p>

  <h2>

  </h2>
  <p>
   your pitch, pace and volume to match the emotions and intensity of the story. Varying your speaking voice adds depth and enhances your stage presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   5. Incorporate multimedia elements
  </p>
  <p>
   Spice up your presentation with a dash of visual pizzazz! Use slides, images and video clips to add depth and clarity to your message. Just remember, less is more—don’t overwhelm them with information overload.
  </p>
  <p>
   Turn your presentations into an interactive party! Involve your audience with questions, polls or group activities. When they actively participate, they become invested in your presentation’s success. Bring your design to life with animated elements. Venngage allows you to apply animations to icons, images and text to create dynamic and engaging visual content.
  </p>
  <p>
   6. Utilize humor strategically
  </p>
  <p>
   Laughter is the best medicine—and a fantastic presentation enhancer! A well-placed joke or lighthearted moment can break the ice and create a warm atmosphere, making your audience more receptive to your message.
  </p>
  <p>
   7. Practice active listening and respond to feedback
  </p>
  <p>
   Be attentive to your audience’s reactions and feedback. If they have questions or concerns, address them with genuine interest and respect. Your responsiveness builds rapport and shows that you genuinely care about their experience.
  </p>
  <p>
   8. Apply the 10-20-30 rule
  </p>
  <p>
   Apply the 10-20-30 presentation rule and keep it short, sweet and impactful! Stick to ten slides, deliver your presentation within 20 minutes and use a 30-point font to ensure clarity and focus. Less is more, and your audience will thank you for it!
  </p>
  <p>
   9. Implement the 5-5-5 rule
  </p>

  <h2>
   Page 123
  </h2>
  <p>
   Simplicity is key. Limit each slide to five bullet points, with only five words per bullet point and allow each slide to remain visible for about five seconds. This rule keeps your presentation concise and prevents information overload.
  </p>
  <p>
   Simple presentations are more engaging because they are easier to follow. Summarize your presentations and keep them simple with Venngage’s gallery of simple presentation templates and ensure that your message is delivered effectively across your audience.

   Choose a Consistent Color Scheme: Select a color scheme that aligns with your topic, brand, or desired tone. Use 2-3 primary colors and a few complementary or accent colors. Ensure consistency throughout the presentation by applying the chosen colors to text, backgrounds, graphs, and other visual elements.
  </p>
  <p>
   3.
  </p>
  <p>
   Use High-Quality Images: Incorporate relevant and high-resolution images to enhance visual appeal. Choose images that support your message and evoke the desired emotions. Ensure that the images are properly sized and formatted for optimal clarity.
  </p>
  <p>
   4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maintain Consistent Font Styles: Select two or three complementary fonts for your presentation— one for headings and titles, and another for body text. Avoid using too many different fonts, as it can appear cluttered. Stick to standard fonts that are easily readable.
  </p>
  <p>
   5.
  </p>
  <p>
   Utilize White Space: Allow for adequate white space (empty space) on each slide to create a clean and uncluttered look. Avoid overcrowding with excessive text, images, or graphics. White space helps guide the viewer's attention to the important elements on the slide.
  </p>
  <p>
   6.
  </p>
  <p>
   Use Clear and Concise Text: Keep the text on each slide concise and easy to read. Use short sentences or phrases and avoid lengthy paragraphs. Use bullet points or numbered lists to break down information into digestible chunks.
  </p>
  <p>
   7.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apply Consistent Slide Layout: Use a consistent slide layout throughout the presentation. Maintain a uniform structure for headings, subheadings, and content placement. This creates a professional and cohesive look.
  </p>
  <p>
   8.
  </p>
  <p>
   Incorporate Visual Hierarchy: Use font size, bold text, or color variations to create a visual hierarchy and emphasize key points. Important information or headings should stand out, while supporting details can be presented in a subtler manner.
  </p>
  <p>
   9.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consider Transitions and Animations: Use slide transitions and animations sparingly and purposefully. They can add interest and help guide the audience's attention, but excessive or distracting effects can detract from the professionalism of the presentation.
  </p>
  <p>
   10.
  </p>
  <p>
   Proofread and Edit: Thoroughly review your presentation for any spelling or grammatical errors. Ensure consistency in formatting, alignment, and spacing. Eliminate unnecessary clutter or redundant information.
  </p>
  <p>
   11.
  </p>
  <p>
   Practice and Rehearse: Before delivering your presentation, practice it multiple times to become familiar with the content and flow. Pay attention to your tone, pacing, and body language. Rehearsing helps you deliver a polished and confident presentation.

   Tips
  </p>
  <p>
   Wednesday,  10:01 AM
  </p>
  <p>
   Start with a goal: Identify what you’re trying to achieve with the presentation. Is it informative, a showcase of data in an easy-to-understand medium? Or is it more of a pitch, something meant to persuade and convince an audience and lead them to a particular outcome? Use facts, figures, and images to support your conclusion while keeping structure in mind.
  </p>
  <p>
   1.
  </p>
  <p>
   Less is more: Avoid cluttering your slides with too much text or images. Keep it simple and visually appealing. Use bullet points to highlight key information.
  </p>
  <p>
   2.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consider your typeface: Choose a font that is easy to read and professional. Avoid using Comic Sans or Papyrus.
  </p>
  <p>
   3.
  </p>
  <p>
   Make bullet points count: Use bullet points to highlight key information. Keep them short and to the point.
  </p>
  <p>
   4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Limit the use of transitions: Transitions can be distracting and take away from the content of your presentation. Use them sparingly.
  </p>
  <p>
   5.
  </p>
  <p>
   Skip text where possible: Use images and graphics to convey your message. This will help keep your audience engaged and interested.
  </p>
  <p>
   6.
  </p>
  <p>
   Think in color: Use color to highlight key information and make your presentation visually appealing. But don’t overdo it.
  </p>
  <p>
   7.
  </p>
  <p>
   Take a look from the top down: Review your presentation from the perspective of your audience. Make sure it’s easy to follow and understand.
  </p>
  <p>
   8.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bonus: Start with templates: If you’re not sure where to start, consider using a pre- designed template. This can help you get started and ensure that your presentation looks professional.

   Salary Negotiation Trick

  <p>
   The salary negotiation trick that works 'time and time again,' according to an ex-Goldman Sachs recruiter

  <p>
   It's never been easier to see how much a job will pay before you go into an interview. More than a dozen states, cities, counties and Washington, D.C. have passed pay disclosure laws, where employers of a certain size are required to list the salary range of an open job. And more than 1 in 4 workers in the U.S. now lives in a place where they're entitled to see pay ranges on job ads.
  </p>
  <p>
   But once you have that information, how can you actually leverage pay ranges to negotiate a job offer? It's as simple as asking one straightforward question in a job interview, says Chanelle Howell, 31, a New York City-based recruiter who's interviewed hundreds while working for Goldman Sachs, Bridgewater Associates and through her own consulting company. She recently gave this example: Say you're interviewing for a position that states the salary range is $100,000 to $150,000. In an interview with the hiring manager or recruiter, ask: "Can you tell me what skills and experiences separate the $100,000 candidate from the $150,000 candidate?" This question will prompt the interviewer to explain their compensation strategy for the role. For example, they might say a candidate in the top end of the range has a certain number of years in the field, managed a certain number of people, led specific projects or is an expert in specific skills. Use this information to then shape what skills and accomplishments you can discuss based on your own background. The key is to repeat these qualities throughout your interview, Howell says, to help build your case for why you're a star candidate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, "later in the negotiation process, you can use their literal words to justify why you deserve more money," Howell says. By the time you reach final conversations and get a verbal offer, it's time to run through

   reach final conversations and get a verbal offer, it's time to run through how you meet the expectations of a top-paid candidate, then counter the offer with your desired pay at the top end of the range. "The key is to push your potential employer to quantify exactly why someone deserves that dollar amount and then to create your story around that," Howell says. Put another way, "get them to give you the answers."
  </p>
  <p>
   What to do if you don't know the salary range
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if you don't live in a state or city where pay range disclosures are required by law, you can still point out that it's a growing practice and that you'd like to apply it in your situation: "Given new pay transparency laws, a lot of companies are sharing pay ranges with candidates. Can you share the range for this role?" Howell says she's seen this strategy work "time and time again" among the people she coaches. One recent client who works in marketing used this framework to negotiate a 20% increase in the initial offer, or a roughly $15,000 to $20,000 boost. Of course, in addition to presenting herself well during the interview, "she was the best candidate," Howell adds. Some job descriptions may list salary ranges that are too wide to be helpful. In those cases, still ask what puts a candidate at the top of the range. For example, a recruiter might say the top of the range is reserved for someone with decades of experience, or a level of seniority you don't have yet. If that's the case, Howell recommends asking what the median pay level is expected to be, and what helps a qualified candidate stand out even a little more than that. And just because you don't get the very top of the range right away doesn't mean you won't work your way there. Howell says it's possible the posted range includes the salary growth expected of the role after a few years. Remember that the base pay range doesn't always consider total compensation, Howell adds. Other elements like a signing bonus, performance-based bonuses and equity can be negotiated at a later stage. That's especially important as wage growth has slowed following a post- pandemic rise. Ultimately, "your first calls with the recruiter or hiring manager are fact-finding missions to use those tidbits of information to build your case at the end and state why you deserve more money," Howell says.

   "How to Win Friends and Influence People"-- the key to being a successful networker is to be GENUINELY interested in other people.
  </p>
  <p>
   Help people talk about themselves!
  </p>
  <p>
   "How do you do that?" he asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   I shared with him the FORD technique for starting a conversation (for the record: I did not invent the FORD acronym, and I, unfortunately, don't know who to attribute it to).
  </p>
  <p>
   F. stands for FAMILY How is your family doing? How is (spouse)? Tell me, what are (age of kids) into these days? Last I heard, (name of the kid) was dominating on the soccer field. Is she still playing?
  </p>
  <p>
   O. stands for OCCUPATION How is your job going? How did you get into your line of work? Are you traveling much for work these days? Are you working on any exciting new projects right now? Have you enjoyed working virtually this year? Are you doing any board or volunteer work this year?
  </p>
  <p>
   R. stands for RECREATION So, are you still (riding bikes, sailing, racing cars, etc.)? By the way, how was your trip to __________? Are you guys going anywhere fun for Spring Break? I know your kid plays ___. Did you do this sport as a kid?
  </p>
  <p>
   D. stands for DREAMS Are you headed anywhere fun this summer for vacation? So, what will you be doing with your time now that you have retired? When you are not working (or with the kids), what are you doing in your "free time"? I was just talking to a friend about the vacant building down the street from here. I wish it was a __. What do you think?
  </p>
  <p>
   Depending on the formality of the setting, end the conversation with "Do you have a business card? Here's my card! Do you mind if I reach out about &lt;…..&gt;? It was so lovely meeting you. ((Also-- it's perfectly acceptable to follow up without asking for a business card. You can Google their name and find their profile ))

   AND THEN ACTUALLY FOLLOW UP.

   Send them a LinkedIn connection request or email. Your message could be simple:

   Hi Jill: I really enjoyed meeting you at the Smith's house last week. I loved learning about the work you are doing with the Downtown Development Board. Your energy for the XX project is exactly what Durham needs. Will you be at the XXX meeting next week? I plan to be there and hope to see you. - Kate

   A video on Unique Value Add (UVA) is a visual presentation that demonstrates the unique value that a product, service, or company brings to its customers or stakeholders. It typically involves a more in- depth exploration of the offering, its benefits, and how it solves a particular problem or satisfies a need. The video might showcase testimonials, case studies, demonstrations, or other visual elements to convey the value proposition effectively. A UVA video is often used as part of a marketing campaign, on a website, social media platforms, or during presentations to provide a more immersive and engaging experience for the audience.

   If you can't explain how you save or make your company enough money to justify the cost of your salary - you can be at risk of being laid-off should the company need to tighten its belt.
